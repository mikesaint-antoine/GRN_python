# GRN_python

Hi everyone! Thanks for checking out my Github repo.

I've spent the past 5 years working on my PhD at the University of Delaware, with much of my research focusing on modeling and simulation and gene regulation. During this time, I've written a lot of code that I think could potentially be useful to other researchers who are doing similar work. My goal with this repo is to collect and organize any code I've written in grad school that others might find useful, and put it out there as an open source python library.
