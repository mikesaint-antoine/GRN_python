# GRN_python

## Introduction
Hi everyone! Thanks for checking out my Github repo.

I've spent the past 5 years working on my PhD at the University of Delaware, with much of my research focusing on modeling and simulation of gene regulation. During this time, I've written a lot of code that I think could potentially be useful to other researchers who are doing similar work. My goal with this project is to collect and organize any code I've written in grad school that others might find useful, and put it out there as an open source Python library.

There are basically 3 subtopics included in the project:

- **Network Inference** - the challenge of figuring out the structure of gene regulatory networks from expression data. This code is in the inference.py file.
- **Simulation** - deterministic and stochastic simulation of gene regulatory interactions and network motifs. This code is in the simulation.py file.
- **Transcriptomics** - standard bioinformatics analysis of gene expression data. This includes heatmap plots, cluster analysis, etc. This code is in the transcriptomics.py file.


## Installation
Eventually I'd like to turn this project into a legit Python library that can be installed with pip, but I'm not at that point yet. So for now, there isn't really an installation. Just download the file with the functions you want to use (inference.py for example), put it in the same folder as your project, and import it into your code ("import inference", for example). Sorry for this being kinda low-tech, but at the moment I think this is the easiest thing to do.
